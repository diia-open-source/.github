![Diia - Source code of the government product open for everyone](https://github.com/diia-open-source/.github/blob/main/profile/header%20profile.png)

# Welcome
Diia is an app with access to citizenâ€™s digital documents and government services.

The application was created so that Ukrainians could interact with the state in a few clicks, without spending their time on queues and paperwork - Diia open source application will help countries, companies and communities build a foundation for long-term relationships. At the heart of these relations are openness, efficiency and humanity.

# Get started
Open Source, or Open Code, is software with code that can be seen by anyone. Open Source shows the quality of programming as well as the logic of application's operation. By making Diia's code publicly available, we gave the opportunity to review, edit, or even modify it by any techie.

# Short-term Roadmap
We will add CI steps through GitHub Actions to test created Pull Requests for backend repositories.

Also, it should be noted that diia-open-source repositories are not an as-is representation of the internal codebase. Instead, they are presented as a snapshot of a particular version for each service or package. We were overwhelmed by the community's passion and feedback and are working on streamlining and simplifying the process for accepting your contributions into the main codebase.
